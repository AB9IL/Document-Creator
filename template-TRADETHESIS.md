# TRADE THESIS CREATED YYYY-MM-DD

---------------------------------

TICKER:

What is the product?  Not just what they ostensibly offer; why do their
customers buy?  People say TSLA is a car company, but really are a battery and
electrical power technology provider.



What is the common narrative for the company's current performance?  Why is it
priced as it is?



Why is the common narrative wrong?  Explain the flaw resulting in a mispricing.



Is your information new or old?  How many days, weeks, or months have you been
able to see the important facts? Did the market see it too?



What is the expected effect on pricing as the market digests better information
about the company and its environment?



Is the future pricing a long term change or a brief excursion due to a bump
in the market?



What is the other side of the argument about the situation?  What favors the
opposite side?



How do you know when the situation is best for opening a position?



What are the factors indicating that the thesis correct and working?



What are the factors indicating that the thesis is wrong or failing?



How do you know when it is time to close the position?



Comment: Study the histories of manias and fads.  Tulipmania, NFTs, and the
others.  You want to be the first one to notice that people like something new.
You also need to be the first to notice that people are losing interest in a
popular thing - to see when they can be distracted by lesser shiny things.
