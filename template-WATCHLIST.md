# WATCHLIST CREATED YYYY-MM-DD

------------------------------

## ACCOMPLISH THIS PROCESS 2 HOURS BEFORE MARKET OPEN
## NO TRADES UNTIL OPEN + 15 MINUTES / NO PLAY IN THE SHARK TANK
## FOCUS ON THE MARKETS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
## RESPECT THE PRESENCE OF SMALLER AND GREATER RANDOMNESS IN ALL THINGS
## RESPECT THE FACT THAT THERE IS AN OPPOSITE SIDE TO EVERY POSITION
---
## PREV DAY & OVERNIGHT SUMMARY...


---
## OBSERVATIONS / CONSIDER THESE...

## Indexes:
 - SPX / SPY / RSP
 - NQ / QQQ

## These tend to lead the markets...
 - IWM
 - DJT
 - JNUG is a reverse canary; if it spikes, something is causing uncertainty or worry.
 - BTC ia another reverse canary.

## Watch these for correlations inverse to the indexes:
## (If indexes are overbought and these are both up, watch for an index correction.)
 - VIX and VVIX
 - TLT
 - /BN

Watch for rotations between industries or market sectors:
 - Tech (GOOG, MSFT, AAPL) in QQQ versus Financials (XLF) versus Energy (XOM)
 - Bonds (TLT, /BN) versus stocks
 - VIX may rise during large cashouts (dumped positions, not a rotation)

Identify the leaders and how they are moving:
 - Who dominates their industry?
 - Who is setting the pace in their actual business?
 - Who moves first and most on up days?
 - Who does not move down as much on down days?

Identify the laggarts and how they are moving:
 - Who is playing catch-up in their industry?
 - Who does not lead with newer and better products and services?
 - Who moves up less on up days and down more on down days?

BULLISH POSITIONING - SEEK START OF UPTREND:
 - limit to first day breaking downtrend or consolidation
 - hitting the top of darvas box as a downtrend ends
 - be more cautious day two and more more cautious each day after
 - continuation is: ascending triangles, repeated hammering, into...
    all time highs
	52 week highs
	last session highs
	high of day including premarket
 - continuation may continue to continue "until it does not" with no warning
 - find tickers becoming "easy to borrow"
	"easy to borrow" means shorts not eager to beat down the ticker
 - buy successful breakout after an ascending triangle
    should have a unique catalyst, not simply a move following overall market
    should break resistance AND new move on daily and weekly time frames
	stop limit buy to be first in after the break
 - do not buy simply because something is cheap or weak
	you do not know when the selling actually ends
	after selling there may be consolidation
	wait for the move up to begin (range, volume, price)
	must identify the rotation out and rotation back in
 - tickers "hard to borrow" are targets for attack by shorts

BEARISH POSITIONING - SPIKES AND PARABOLIC MOVES ARE TARGETS:
 - find descending triangles, repeated hammering, into...
    all time lows
	52 week lows
	last session lows
	low of day including premarket
 - watch for sharp breaks up followed by breaks all the way back down
 - sell breakdowns after a descending triangle
	stop limit to short when the support breaks
 - good if trend down steepens and volume increases after the break

GAPS AND BREAKS UP OR DOWN:
 - pay attention to prices where the gaps, breaks up and breaks down are located
 - pay attention to events associated with gaps and breaks
 - price moves to gaps for a test
 - price moves across gaps to test the other side
 - bottoms of breaks up get tested
 - tops of break downs get tested

## After doing the thinking, make the list.

## WATCHLIST... (bullish - recent ipo - pushing up to top of darvas boxes)
**WATCH MEANS WATCH - NOT BUY**

## Individual Names:
### (NON BETA)

## Why are these uptrending (Why would whales buy?)?


## Why are these downtrending (Why would whales sell)?

## TECHNICALS...

A more sophisticated "top of trend" scanner:
(Find a trend, identify divergences)

## Within last 15 sessions, volume:
 - Price down on the two highest volume days.
 - Price up on the two lowest volume days.
## Within the last 15 sessions, price action:

## Get a daily list of these, look for put sweepers.

The next leg down involves the 50 SMA / 200 SMA death hook.
(50 MA levels off and starts moving down.

After that comes the 50 / 200 death cross.

The price versus 20 and 50 SMAs is also relevant.

---
## Event Sequence of a Cracked Uptrend.
---
Previous several days price action develops into parabolic frenzy.
On the day it cracks:
 - initially higher highs and higher lows (draw trendlines to mark channel)
 - top is rejected; longer intraday time frame shows "shooting star / inverted hammer"
 - break below 9 period ema on 5 minute time frame
 - break below the channel
 - lower highs and lower lows (lower high AND lower low are critical)

What about entries?
 - Madmen will buy puts after a bearish engulfing candle appears
   - wait for retest then risk off top of the candle
 - small put orders when 5 min candles have lower highs and wicks
   - confirmation of rejection of higher prices

Volume delta:
 - loss of aggressive buyers; arrival of aggressive sellers
 - aggressive sellers don't appear immediately
 - aggressive buyers do disappear quickly
 - make note of trends: magnitude and rate of aggressors
 - make note of when aggressors enter and leave the market
